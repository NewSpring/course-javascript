# JavaScript 101 App

1. Pick a place on your computer to setup shop. If you are unsure, you can always use your home 
   directory:

  ```
  cd ~
  ```

2. In your chosen spot, "clone or download" the [repo](https://github.com/NewSpring/course-javascript). To clone, use 
   this command: 

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/NewSpring/course-javascript.git
  cd course-javascript/resources/app/
  ```
  
3. [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) is a JavaScript framework we'll use in the class. Don't worry too much about what 
   Meteor is yet, just install it using this command:
  
  ```
  curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
  ```
  
4. Fire it up, up, up. You should see `Hello, world!` printed to your browser's developer console at `localhost:3000` 
   and also in the terminal once Meteor installs everything.
  
  ```
  meteor
  ```
